          <p>CreatHives, an incubated company at Entrepreneurship Development Cell has been able to connect to various
            investors and grant agencies.
            It all began in 2011, when a bunch of theatre enthusiasts from Ramaiah college were asked to put up a
            performance for the Bangalore Mirror Amateur Theatre Festival. When they showcased their act, 86, based on
            the Sri Lankan civil war, they left their judge in tears. It was on that day, TEA Arts, a creative arts
            society was formed. From enacting scripts that were close to their heart to mentoring nearly 150 artists who
            have gone on to break ground in the arenas of performing and digital
            arts gave them immense motivation. TEA Arts pioneered The Bangalore Theatre League the same year and has
            gone on to host two consecutive leagues thereafter. Simultaneously, TEA Arts, has been chosen to host
            performance campaigns for The Times of India, Bangalore Mirror, Fortis Hospitals, The Wedding Filmer,
            Dream-ADream and CRY among a spectrum of other media, profit, and not for profit.
            With this expansive and interesting experience in their portfolio, they now
            endeavour to scale the activities of TEA Arts both to reach a wider audience pan India as well as include a
            wider range of existing and upcoming creative arts into its scale. Their vision is detailed, scalable and
            born out of hands on experience in the field. At
            this juncture, there is the inevitable hurdle of bringing focus within the arts segment given the imbalance
            between the market requirement and what the artists have to oﬀer.It's a great new web application that
            enables networking between artists and vendors in need of artists such as NGOs, Corporate sectors, other
            commercial set-ups, etc. CreatHives is an initiative that brings to focus, the imbalance between the market
            requirement and what the artists have to offer. We, at CreatHives, cater to both ends of a creative
            collaboration, finding the right artist for creative needs and the artist finding the right kind of work.
            Now you can meet other artists, trainers, vendors, and network all you want with just a few clicks.
